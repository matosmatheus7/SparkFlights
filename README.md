# SparkFlights
This repository contains a PySpark project that demonstrates various functions and capabilities of PySpark for analyzing a small flights dataset. The project focuses on utilizing the power of PySpark's distributed processing capabilities to efficiently process and analyze flight data.

- **Data Ingestion:** The project provides modules for loading data from CSV files into a PySpark DataFrame.
- **Data Transformation:** PySpark's powerful transformation functions are utilized to clean and preprocess the flight data, including handling missing values, data type conversions, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The project showcases different EDA techniques using PySpark, including descriptive statistics and correlation analysis.
- **Aggregation and Grouping:** PySpark's groupBy and aggregation functions are demonstrated to summarize flight data based on different criteria, such as airports, airlines, or time periods.
